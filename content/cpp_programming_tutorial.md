## 1. Introduction to C++

C++ is a general-purpose, high-performance programming language widely used in scenarios requiring performance-critical software, such as games, real-time systems, and applications with intensive computational needs.

### History of C++

- Developed by **Bjarne Stroustrup** in 1979 at Bell Labs.
- Designed to enhance the C programming language by adding object-oriented features.
- C++ is one of the most influential languages in modern programming.

## 2. Setting Up Your Environment

To start writing C++ programs, set up a development environment by following these steps:

### Step 1: Install a C++ Compiler

- **Windows:**
  - Use **MinGW** or **Microsoft Visual Studio**.
- **macOS:**
  - Install **Xcode** or use **Homebrew** to install the `g++` compiler.
- **Linux:**
  - Install `g++` using your distribution’s package manager (`sudo apt install g++` for Ubuntu).

### Step 2: Install a Text Editor or IDE

- Popular options:
  - **Visual Studio Code**
  - **CLion**
  - **Code::Blocks**

### Step 3: Verify Installation

Run the following command in your terminal to check if the compiler is installed:

```bash
g++ --version
```

## 3. Basic Syntax and Structure

Here’s what a simple C++ program looks like:

```cpp showLineNumbers
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
    return 0;
}

```

## 4. Variables and Data Types

Variables are containers used to store data values. C++ supports various data types, each suited for specific purposes.

### Common Data Types

```
| Data Type | Description                        | Example                      |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `int`     | Integer values                     | `int age = 25;`              |
| `float`   | Floating-point numbers             | `float pi = 3.14;`           |
| `double`  | Double-precision numbers           | `double largePi = 3.141592;` |
| `char`    | Single characters                  | `char grade = 'A';`          |
| `string`  | Textual data                       | `string name = "John";`      |
| `bool`    | Boolean values (`true` or `false`) | `bool isActive = true;`      |
```

---

### Example Code: Using Variables and Data Types

Here’s an example of defining and using different variable types in C++:

```cpp showLineNumbers
#include <iostream>
#include <string> // Required for using strings
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int age = 25;             // Integer
    float height = 5.9;       // Floating-point
    char grade = 'A';         // Character
    string name = "John";     // String
    bool isActive = true;     // Boolean

    // Display the variables
    cout << "Name: " << name << endl;
    cout << "Age: " << age << endl;
    cout << "Height: " << height << endl;
    cout << "Grade: " << grade << endl;
    cout << "Active: " << (isActive ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;

    return 0;
}

```

---

## 5. Control Structures

Control structures are used to determine the flow of a program. C++ provides several control structures like conditional statements and loops to manage program execution.

---

### Conditional Statements

#### If-Else Statement

The `if-else` statement allows you to execute code based on a condition.

```cpp showLineNumbers
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int age = 18;

    if (age >= 18) {
        cout << "You are eligible to vote." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "You are not eligible to vote." << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Nested If-Else Statement

Nested `if-else` allows you to check multiple conditions within other conditions.

```cpp showLineNumbers
if (condition1) {
    if (condition2) {
        // Code if both condition1 and condition2 are true
    } else {
        // Code if condition1 is true and condition2 is false
    }
} else {
    // Code if condition1 is false
}

```

## Switch Statement Syntax

The `switch` statement is used to execute one block of code among many based on the value of an expression.

---

### Syntax

```cpp showLineNumbers
switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        // Code to execute if expression == value1
        break; // Exit the switch block
    case value2:
        // Code to execute if expression == value2
        break;
    // You can add more cases as needed
    default:
        // Code to execute if no cases match
        // Default case is optional
}
```

---

## Loops in C++

Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a certain condition is true. They help reduce redundancy and make code more efficient. C++ provides the following types of loops:

1. **For Loop**
2. **While Loop**
3. **Do-While Loop**

---

### 5.1. For Loop

The `for` loop is used when the number of iterations is known beforehand. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and update.

#### Syntax

```cpp showLineNumbers
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // Code to execute repeatedly
}
```

#### Example: Printing Numbers

```cpp showLineNumbers
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
        cout << "Number: " << i << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}

```

---

## 5.2. While Loop in C++

The `while` loop is used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as the specified condition is true. It is particularly useful when the number of iterations is not known beforehand.

### Syntax

```cpp showLineNumbers
while (condition) {
    // Code to execute while the condition is true
}
```

#### Example: Printing Numbers from 1 to 5

```cpp showLineNumbers
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int i = 1; // Initialization

    while (i <= 5) { // Condition
        cout << "Number: " << i << endl; // Code to execute
        i++; // Increment
    }

    return 0;
}

```

---

## 5.3 Do-While Loop in C++

The `do-while` loop ensures that the code block executes at least once before the condition is checked. This makes it useful when the loop body must run at least one time regardless of the condition.

### Syntax

```cpp showLineNumbers
do {
    // Code to execute
} while (condition);
```

#### Example: Printing Numbers from 1 to 5

```cpp showLineNumbers
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int i = 1; // Initialization

    do {
        cout << "Number: " << i << endl; // Code to execute
        i++; // Increment
    } while (i <= 5); // Condition

    return 0;
}

```

---

## 6. Functions in C++

Functions are reusable blocks of code designed to perform a specific task. They help organize code, improve readability, and promote code reuse.

---

### Syntax

```cpp showLineNumbers
return_type function_name(parameters) {
    // Function body: statements to execute
    return value; // Optional (for non-void functions)
}
```

#### Example: Adding Two Numbers

```cpp showLineNumbers
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function declaration
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    int num1 = 5, num2 = 10;
    cout << "Sum: " << add(num1, num2) << endl; // Function call
    return 0;
}

```

---

## 7. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain both data and functions. The core principles of OOP are:

1. **Encapsulation**
2. **Inheritance**
3. **Polymorphism**
4. **Abstraction**

Each of these principles helps structure programs more efficiently, making them easier to manage and scale.

---

## Class and Object

A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects. Objects are instances of classes. A class can contain data members (variables) and member functions (methods) that define the behaviors of the object.

### Syntax

```cpp showLineNumbers
class ClassName {
    public:
        int variable; // Member variable
        void functionName(); // Member function declaration
};

void ClassName::functionName() {
    // Function definition
}

int main() {
    ClassName object; // Object creation
    object.functionName(); // Access function
    return 0;
}
```

---

## Constructor and Destructor

- **Constructor**: Special member function that is automatically called when an object is created. It is used to initialize objects.
- **Destructor**: Special member function that is automatically called when an object goes out of scope. It is used to clean up resources.

#### Syntax:

```cpp showLineNumbers
class ClassName {
    public:
        // Constructor
        ClassName() {
            // Initialization code
        }

        // Destructor
        ~ClassName() {
            // Cleanup code
        }
};

int main() {
    ClassName object; // Constructor is called
    return 0; // Destructor is automatically called
}
```

---

## 7.1. Encapsulation

**Encapsulation** is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit (class). It helps hide the internal workings of a class and only exposes necessary functionalities to the outside world.

#### Syntax

```cpp showLineNumbers
class Example {
    private:
        int data; // Private data

    public:
        void setData(int value) {
            data = value; // Set the private data
        }

        int getData() {
            return data; // Get the private data
        }
};

int main() {
    Example obj;
    obj.setData(100); // Setting the value using setter
    cout << obj.getData(); // Getting the value using getter
    return 0;
}
```

---

## 7.2. Inheritance

**Inheritance** allows a new class (derived class) to inherit the properties and methods of an existing class (base class). This promotes code reuse and allows for a hierarchy of classes.

#### Syntax:

```cpp showLineNumbers
class BaseClass {
    public:
        void baseFunction() {
            // Base class function
        }
};

class DerivedClass : public BaseClass {
    public:
        void derivedFunction() {
            // Derived class function
        }
};

int main() {
    DerivedClass object;
    object.baseFunction(); // Accessing base class function
    object.derivedFunction(); // Accessing derived class function
    return 0;
}
```

---

## 7.3. Polymorphism

**Polymorphism** allows methods to behave differently based on the object calling them. There are two types of polymorphism: **Function Overloading** and **Function Overriding**.

### Function Overloading

Function overloading allows defining multiple functions with the same name but different parameters.

```cpp showLineNumbers
class Example {
    public:
        void func() {
            // No arguments
        }

        void func(int x) {
            // One argument
        }

        void func(int x, int y) {
            // Two arguments
        }
};
```

### Function Overriding

Function overriding allows a derived class to provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in its base class.

```cpp showLineNumbers
class Base {
    public:
        virtual void display() {
            // Base class display
        }
};

class Derived : public Base {
    public:
        void display() override {
            // Derived class display
        }
};

int main() {
    Base *obj;
    Derived derivedObj;
    obj = &derivedObj;

    obj->display(); // Calls Derived class display
    return 0;
}
```

## 7.4. Abstraction

**Abstraction** is the concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. It can be achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.

#### Syntax

```cpp showLineNumbers
class AbstractClass {
    public:
        virtual void abstractMethod() = 0; // Pure virtual function
};

class DerivedClass : public AbstractClass {
    public:
        void abstractMethod() override {
            // Implementation of abstractMethod
        }
};

int main() {
    DerivedClass obj;
    obj.abstractMethod(); // Calls the derived class implementation
    return 0;
}
```

---

## Advanced Concepts in C++

### 1. Templates

Templates allow you to write generic and reusable code. They are a cornerstone of C++ metaprogramming.

- **Function Templates**  
  Enables defining functions that can work with any data type.  
  Example:

  ```cpp showLineNumbers
  template <typename T>
  T add(T a, T b) {
      return a + b;
  }
  ```

- Class Templates
  Similar to function templates but for classes.
  Example:

```cpp showLineNumbers
template <typename T>
class MyClass {
    T value;
public:
    MyClass(T v) : value(v) {}
    T getValue() { return value; }
};
```

### 2. Standard Template Library (STL)

STL provides pre-written, highly optimized template classes and functions for common tasks.

- **Containers**
  Efficiently manage collections of data. Examples:

- vector: Dynamic array.
- list: Doubly linked list.
- map: Key-value storage.
- set: Unique, ordered elements.

- **Iterators**
  Abstract pointers for navigating through containers.
  Example:

```cpp showLineNumbers
for (auto it = container.begin(); it != container.end(); ++it) {
    std::cout << *it;
}
```

- Algorithms
  Perform operations like sorting, searching, and transforming containers.
  Example:

```cpp showLineNumbers
std::sort(vec.begin(), vec.end());
```

### 3. Smart Pointers

Smart pointers automate memory management and prevent memory leaks.

- unique_ptr
  Owns a resource and ensures no other pointer can access it.
  Example:

  ```cpp showLineNumbers
  std::unique_ptr<int> ptr = std::make_unique<int>(10);
  ```

- shared_ptr
  Shared ownership; multiple pointers can share the same resource.
  Example:

```cpp showLineNumbers
std::shared_ptr<int> ptr1 = std::make_shared<int>(20);
std::shared_ptr<int> ptr2 = ptr1;

```

### 4. Memory Management

C++ provides fine-grained control over memory allocation, which can be critical for performance and resource-constrained systems.

- Dynamic Memory Allocation
  Allocate memory at runtime using new and delete.
  Example:

```cpp showLineNumbers
int* ptr = new int(5);
delete ptr;
```

- Custom Allocators
  STL containers can use custom memory allocators for specialized memory management.

- Memory Pools
  Pre-allocated blocks of memory for objects of similar size, improving efficiency in high-performance applications.

### 5. Move Semantics and Rvalue References

Introduced in C++11, these concepts optimize resource management by eliminating unnecessary copies.

- Move Constructor
  Transfers ownership of resources instead of copying them.
  Example:

  ```cpp showLineNumbers
  class MyClass {
    int* data;
  public:
    MyClass(int val) : data(new int(val)) {}
    MyClass(MyClass&& other) noexcept : data(other.data) {
        other.data = nullptr;
    }
    ~MyClass() { delete data; }
  };

  ```

  - Rvalue References (&&)
    Allows binding to temporary (rvalue) objects, enabling efficient manipulation.
    Example:

    ```cpp showLineNumbers
    void process(std::string&& str) {
    std::cout << "Processing: " << str;
    }
    process(std::move(name));
    ```

---

## Conclusion

C++ is a powerful, versatile programming language that offers both high-level features and low-level control. By mastering its advanced concepts such as templates, STL, smart pointers, memory management, and move semantics, developers can write efficient and reusable code that scales well in performance-critical applications.

With a rich ecosystem of tools and libraries, C++ remains a language of choice for system programming, game development, and real-time applications. Its ability to combine object-oriented programming, generic programming, and procedural programming paradigms ensures its relevance across a wide range of domains.

For those looking to deepen their understanding, exploring these advanced topics not only enhances programming skills but also opens doors to solving complex, real-world challenges with elegance and efficiency. C++ is more than just a language—it's a bridge between machine and programmer.
