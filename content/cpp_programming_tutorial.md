## Introduction to C++

C++ is a general-purpose, high-performance programming language that is widely used for developing software where performance is critical, such as games, real-time systems, and applications requiring high performance.

### History of C++

- Developed by **Bjarne Stroustrup** in 1979 at Bell Labs.
- Originally designed to be an enhancement to the C programming language by adding object-oriented features.

## Setting Up Your Environment

Before you can start writing C++ programs, you need to set up a development environment. Follow these steps:

1. **Install a C++ compiler:**

   - On Windows, you can use **MinGW** or **Microsoft Visual Studio**.
   - On macOS, you can use **Xcode** or **Homebrew** to install the `g++` compiler.
   - On Linux, install `g++` using your package manager.

2. **Install a text editor or IDE:**
   - **Visual Studio Code**, **CLion**, or **Code::Blocks** are popular choices for writing C++ code.

## Basic Syntax and Structure

A simple C++ program looks like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
