## Introduction to C++

C++ is a general-purpose, high-performance programming language widely used in scenarios requiring performance-critical software, such as games, real-time systems, and applications with intensive computational needs.

### History of C++

- Developed by **Bjarne Stroustrup** in 1979 at Bell Labs.
- Designed to enhance the C programming language by adding object-oriented features.
- C++ is one of the most influential languages in modern programming.

## Setting Up Your Environment

To start writing C++ programs, set up a development environment by following these steps:

### Step 1: Install a C++ Compiler

- **Windows:**
  - Use **MinGW** or **Microsoft Visual Studio**.
- **macOS:**
  - Install **Xcode** or use **Homebrew** to install the `g++` compiler.
- **Linux:**
  - Install `g++` using your distributionâ€™s package manager (`sudo apt install g++` for Ubuntu).

### Step 2: Install a Text Editor or IDE

- Popular options:
  - **Visual Studio Code**
  - **CLion**
  - **Code::Blocks**

### Step 3: Verify Installation

Run the following command in your terminal to check if the compiler is installed:

```bash
g++ --version
```
