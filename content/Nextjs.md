# Introduction to Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework for building modern web applications. It simplifies the process of creating server-rendered React apps and provides essential features out of the box.

## Why Use Next.js?

Next.js is designed to address common pain points in modern web development. Here are some reasons why it’s a great choice:

### 1. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**

- Out-of-the-box support for SSR, which improves performance and SEO by rendering pages on the server.

### 2. **Static Site Generation (SSG)**

- Enables building static pages at build time, which is perfect for blogs, landing pages, and marketing websites.

### 3. **API Routes**

- Built-in support for creating serverless functions as API endpoints within the same project.

### 4. **Image Optimization**

- Comes with an image component that automatically optimizes images for better performance.

### 5. **File-Based Routing**

- Simplifies the creation of routes using the file system, with dynamic routing capabilities.

## Key Features of Next.js

Here are some features that make Next.js stand out:

- **Automatic Code Splitting**: Only loads the JavaScript required for the page.
- **Built-in CSS Support**: Supports global stylesheets and CSS-in-JS solutions like styled-components.
- **Fast Refresh**: Provides live editing experience similar to Create React App.
- **TypeScript Support**: Fully compatible with TypeScript out of the box.

## Getting Started with Next.js

To get started, install Next.js in your project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
cd my-next-app
npm run dev
```
